1️⃣ OSPF Cost

This is how OSPF decides the “best path”.

Lower cost = preferred path.

Each link/interface has a cost, and OSPF adds them up along a path to pick the lowest total.


Formula:

\text{OSPF Cost} = \frac{\text{Reference Bandwidth}}{\text{Interface Bandwidth}}

If multiple paths to the same destination, OSPF picks the one with lowest total cost.

2️⃣ OSPF Metric

In OSPF, the metric = cost.

Some protocols call it “metric,” OSPF calls it cost, but basically it’s the same idea: “how good/bad a path is.”



---

3️⃣ Bandwidth

This is the speed of the interface in bits per second.

Examples:

FastEthernet = 100 Mbps

GigabitEthernet = 1 Gbps


Used in the cost formula. Higher bandwidth → lower cost → more preferred.



---

4️⃣ Reference Bandwidth

This is a constant OSPF uses as the numerator in the cost formula.

Default = 100 Mbps in Cisco (old), but often changed for modern networks.

Example: On Gigabit links, default 100 Mbps → cost = 100 / 1000 = 0.1 → rounded to 1 (Cisco always rounds down to 1 min)


Tip: If you don’t adjust reference bandwidth in modern high-speed networks, OSPF may treat 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps links as equal cost, which is not what you want.

5️⃣ Clock Rate

Relevant for serial interfaces in lab or point-to-point WANs.

Only set on the DCE (Data Communication Equipment) side of the serial link.

Defines the speed of the serial link. OSPF uses interface bandwidth for cost, so the faster the clock rate, the higher the “bandwidth” OSPF sees → lower cost.


TL;DR: Clock rate → bandwidth → cost → OSPF chooses best path.


---

6️⃣ Putting It All Together

OSPF looks at all paths.

For each interface, it calculates:


\text{Cost} = \frac{\text{Reference Bandwidth}}{\text{Interface Bandwidth}}

Path with lowest total cost wins.

On serial links, set clock rate if you’re labbing, otherwise OSPF sees the default bandwidth.



---

💡 Example

Reference bandwidth = 100 Mbps

FastEthernet = 100 Mbps → Cost = 100/100 = 1

GigabitEthernet = 1000 Mbps → Cost = 100/1000 = 0.1 → rounded 1

10 Gbps = 10000 Mbps → Cost = 100/10000 = 0.01 → rounded 1 (so for big networks, adjust reference bandwidth!)
